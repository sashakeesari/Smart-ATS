#Smart ATS (Streamlit + Gemini)

In this project, we present a two-portal Applicant Tracking System built with Streamlit and powered by Gemini API.

*Candidate Portal – Upload resumes, fill in details, and apply for jobs.
*HR Portal – Post jobs, auto-shortlist candidates (≥70% match), and schedule interviews.
*Interview Scheduler – Three stages (L1, L2, HR) with SMTP-based email notifications sent automatically.
